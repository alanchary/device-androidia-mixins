# The unity replacment feature

This feature is designed to improve the performance
of arm apps developed with unity engine in PRC market.
The basic idea is to prepare authorized x86 unity libraries
under verdor partition. When running the permitted apps, the
x86 unity engine is loaded, instead of arm alternatives in app
APKs.
When installing the apps with unity, this feature in PackageManager
will compare the MD5 values of arm untiy libraries. If authorized,
and the package name of this app is permitted in the list under
/vendor/lib(64)/.u.check.list, the soft links to x86 unity
libraries is created under app lib directory, instead of copying
the arm unit libraries out of APK.
NOTE: The feature will be disabled if the GooglePlay Store is found
on the device.
