# The PRC compatibility feature

In PRC market, some APKs are packed in non-standard way, that is,
the x86(_64) libraries aren't workable although they're found in the APK.
This patch intends to relieve the impact from below 2 defects,
which is based-on the heuristic algorithm.

1. Missing x86(_64) libraries: The x86(_64) libraries are ported and
   existing in the APK. But it's incomplete, and not workable.
2. Mixed arm(64) libraries: Several libraries are existing in lib/x86(_64)/
   directory in the APK. But some of them are arm(64) libraries,
   instead of x86(_64) ones.

All of above always cause APP crash if installed x86(_64) libraries
by PackageManager.

This patch aims to improve PackageManager to figure out these defects
and install arm(64) libraries to run the APP with houdini support.
The basic idea is to compare x86(_64) libraries with arm(64) alternatives
to determine which one should be workable.

To customize it for specific APPs, 3 lists are provided under
/system/vendor/etc/misc/ on the device.

1. /system/vendor/etc/misc/.OEMWhiteList:
   This patch will be disabled for the apps contained in the OEMWhiteList.
2. /system/vendor/etc/misc/.OEMBlackList:
   The APPs are enforced to install the arm(64) libraries if existed
   in OEMBlacklList.
3. /system/vendor/etc/misc/.ThirdPartySO:
   This is another list which contains the names of all 3rd-party libraries,
   which will impact on the final decision of APP installation. It should be
   maintained according to the status quo by adding new finding 3rd-party
   libraries or removing obsoleted ones.
