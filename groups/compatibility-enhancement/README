# The Compatiblity Enhancement feature

This feature is created for some corner cases of
app compatibility issue. Currently, it aims to
handle below issues:

1. All native libraries are put under assets directory.
Some apps put their libraries under the assets directory
in their APKs, instead of lib directory. It is not a
problem if the ABI of app libs is matched with platform
default ABI. But for apps with other ABIs, this feature
must be enabled to call native bridge for help.
