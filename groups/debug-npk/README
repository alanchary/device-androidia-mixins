                             debug-npk
                             =========

debug-npk group enables debug features related to North Peak.
Particularly, this allows to redirect the android logs to
North Peak so that they are aggregated with other platform logs.

Associated service is 'ap_lognpk', which executes logcatext to
redirect Android logs to North Peak.

Debug only mixins consideration
-------------------------------

This feature is part of 'debug-*' groups, which are dedicated to debug
and product stabilisation, thus do not target final products and user
builds.

As per build variant (eng, userdebug, user) dedicated files feature is
not available with mixins, per option files are provided in
'device/intel/common/debug/' folder and will be included at build time
regarding selected option.

Logging configuration
---------------------

The North Peak configuration is triggered through properties.
The configuration is persistent across reboots.

 *) Update the current configuration

Set npk.cfg.update property. Eg.

    setprop npk.cfg.update pstore,sw,fw

This will trigger a runtime re-configuration of the North Peak.
The current configuration can be seen in persist.npk.cfg.

The configuration value is a comma separated list starting with the output
and followed by all sources to be enabled.

    <output>,<source>[,<source>...]

output:
    pstore
    dvc
    pti
source:
    android
    kernel
    fw
    sw(=android,kernel)

 *) Override configuration

The configuration can be forced through the kernel command line with
    androidboot.npk.cfg=<output>,<source>[,<source>...]

Note that this will set android property ro.boot.npk.cfg.

Changing the configuration with npk.cfg.update will have no effect in this
case.
