                           debug-crashlogd
                           ===============

crashlogd is a daemon intended to track device state, up-time and
crashes. Collected data is tracked in '/data/logs/history_event' file
with one line per logged event. If level of information does not fit
this format, a dedicated folder per event is created and tracked in
the history_event file. Created folder contains metadata, AP logs and
event specific files.

Collected data come from different components :
 - AP logs, from ap_logfs service (logcat to /data/logs/aplog)
 - Android framework, mainly dropbox (/data/system/dropbox)
 - Panic and watchdogs logs, from pstore and other drivers
 - Modem logs and events from MMGR library
 - Our own framework which could collect events from kernel,
   user-space using different APIs : inotify, LCT/KCT.

Produced data could be consumed by embedded tools (Phone Doctor, MPM)
or host tools (MPTA, ACS). Those tools could upload data to crashtool
server (http://crashtool.tl.intel.com) for post-mortem analysis.

Mixin parameters
----------------

* ssram_crashlog: on some platform(s), there is no BERT ACPI table,
   but FW crashlog can be retrieved directly from SSRAM.
   The value of that option is used to identify the platform.
   Currently, only "broxton" platform is supported.
* ramdump: when this option is set, on some specific conditions,
   crashlogd will run in RAMDUMP mode, meaning that it will force a
   reboot after having collected the kernel panic/watchdog debug data.
   In user build, reboot is directly issued by init on defined
   bootreason. The value of that option is used to identify the
   platform.

Debug only mixins consideration
-------------------------------

This feature is part of 'debug-*' groups, which are dedicated to debug
and product stabilisation, thus do not target final products and user
builds.

As per build variant (eng, userdebug, user) dedicated files feature is
not available with mixins, per option files are provided in
'device/intel/common/debug/' folder and will be included at build time
regarding selected option.
