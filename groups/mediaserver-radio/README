                             ================
In order to support audio voice use cases, CoE Audio HAL SW architecture obliges
us to add the "radio" group permission to the media server service.
This group is needed in order to:
    open a MMGR (modem manager) socket
    open a gsmtty in order to send AT commands to the modem
